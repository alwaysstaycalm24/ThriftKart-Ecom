# USED GOODS BUYING AND SELLING PLATFORM

## _ThriftKart_

ThriftKart is an E-commerce (virtual) store, where customers can browse the
catalog and select products of interest. Customers directly buy used goods
without any intermediary service over the internet. It allows users to search for
products based on different categories, add in cart or save in wish-list. It
provides online as well as offline (Cash on Delivery) payment options for
registered users. The main idea is to develop a web-based interface for ecommerce of used goods, the user-friendly interface will make the shopping
experience pleasant for the users. This project is an attempt to provide the
advantages of online shopping to customers of physical stores for buying used
goods.
